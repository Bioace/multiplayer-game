This repository consists of 3 tightly related projects -- client side, server side and library  
which is shared by both client and server.  
 
Written in Java SE 8. Eclipse environment.
 
/*********Running projects************/ 
 
 
//Server side 
 
To run MultiPlayerServer project you have to pass only one argument -- TCP port. This number has to be 
the same as in the client side (look below) otherwise client will not be able to connect the server. 
example: 
7896 
 
 
//Client side 

Default lwjgl natives are compatible with windows. Change that if you use other OS.
 
To run MultiPlayerClient project you have to pass arguments in such order 

1. IP of server where server side is running 

2. TCP port of server 

3. UDP port through which the game play will be updated (firewalls and router might block incoming traffic) 
 
example: 
If server runs on localhost: 
localhost 7896 1234
